=============================


Includes a quick viewer which allows searching through a database of approximately 1400 characters (a small portion of which are incorrect). Also includes a simple program to generate multiple choice questions. Allows tracking of incorrect answers, searching through all available kanji, and copying a kanji to the clipboard. Additional kanji may be loaded simply by placing bitmapped images in the relevant folders.
